## Dependencies
The project uses the following dependencies:
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

To install the dependencies, run:
```bash
npm install
```

## Code Explanation
### index.js
The `index.js` file sets up a basic Express server and defines a single route that responds with "Hello, World!".

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Use the PORT environment variable or default to 3000
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Create a single route that responds with 'Hello, World!'
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Import Express**: The code starts by importing the Express module.
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   ```

2. **Initialize Express**: An instance of an Express application is created.
   ```javascript
   const app = express();
   ```

3. **Set the Port**: The server listens on a port specified by the `PORT` environment variable. If the `PORT` environment variable is not set, it defaults to port 3000.
   ```javascript
   const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
   ```

4. **Define the Route**: A single route is defined that responds with "Hello, World!" when accessed via a GET request.
   ```javascript
   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
     res.send('Hello, World!');
   });
   ```

5. **Start the Server**: The server starts listening on the specified port, and a message is logged to the console indicating that the server is running.
   ```javascript
   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

## Deployment
The server is deployed and accessible at the URL specified in the `$HELLO_WORLD_SERVER_URL` environment variable. The deployment process ensures that the server is running and accessible to users.
